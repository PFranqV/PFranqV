Iâ€™m @PFranqV ðŸ‘‹ 
I am actually learning computational and physical chemistry.  
The reason for using GitHub is to compile a collection of my work and learning from the past few years, explained by me, for myself, to resolve future questions and easily return to the fundamentals. 
Hence, my repositories and information will be public in case anyone wishes to use them as a learning tool for themselves.
