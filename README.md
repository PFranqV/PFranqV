Hi! ðŸ¤™ 
Just for collecting & packing some of the exercises and learning material

* MD contains a basic molecular dynamics program to perform simulations of LJ fluids
        *Unfinished* - some properties are missing. Estimated Time of Availability, *ETA*= Unknown
* Project-I contains both serial/parallel MD programs for a Kr gas developed as a Master's group-project.
* Python-exercises: Collections of chemistry/physics exercises solved in Jupyter Notebooks
