Hi! ðŸ¤™ 
Just for collecting & packing some of the exercises and learning material

* MD contains a basic molecular dynamics program to perform simulations of LJ fluids. Master's project revisited. 
            *Unfinished* - some properties are missing. *ETA*= Unknown
* Project-I contains both serial/parallel MD programs for a Kr gas developed as a Master's group-project.
* QFIII-EE exs: Collections of physical chemistry ane electronic structure (EE) exercises solved in Jupyter Notebooks
